<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was an opportunity for me to utilize my self-taught front-end skills and existing back-end knowledge to build an ecommerce platform. However, I soon realized that my skills in both areas were not sufficient, and I lacked full-stack knowledge, including how to establish communication between the front end and back end. Despite these challenges, I took pride in this project because it motivated me to learn and explore various technologies, such as C# Web API, Redux, JWT tokens, and HTTP methods and API development in general.

### Built With

* React.js
* Microsoft SQL Server
* .NET Web API
* Redux
* SCSS
